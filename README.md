# Meoko-Desktop
An experimental WPF desktop client for Yash-Garg's Nyaa-Api-Go server. Cross platform capabilities will be introduced later.

Meoko-Desktop is a desktop client for the [Nyaa-Api-Go](https://github.com/Yash-Garg/Nyaa-Api-Go) API server written by Yash Garg. It is a cross platform desktop client that can be used to search for anime and pass them along to an installed torrent client. The aim of this project is to provice an easy to use desktop client as well as a dotnet core library to act as a wrapper for the Nyaa-Api-Go server. The client is currently in active development and is not yet ready for use.

There is also plans to implement a CLI-based client in the future as well as a hostable web UI for managing the server. The server may also receive a re-write in ASP dotnet later down the road to allow for complete dotnet support.
